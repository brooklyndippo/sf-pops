1. As a remote worker, I want to be able to find public places to work on the go, so that I don't have to work in crowded cafes. 

2. As a mom, I want to find outdoor spaces where children can play after school and where there is also a cafe, so that I can enjoy a coffee while they play. 

3. As a real estate agent, I want to be able to easily reference and share nearby public places with clients interested in different listings, so that I can convey the value of a location.
